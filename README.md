pyoptics
========

About
-----

pyoptics is a collection of tools for wave optical simulation. It contains
classes for imaging simulations and wave propagation. pyoptics has a modular
structure that easily allows reuse of individual blocks in new contexts.

Configuration and installation
------------------------------

For the time being, pyoptics is a pure Python package. Thus, distutils might
be the obvious choice as a setup tool. However, because the alternative tool
waf deals gracefully with all of Python, Cython, C/C++ and Fortran, we use waf
to be beter prepared for whatever the future may bring.

Should it be named pyoptikum instead?
